What is a POM?
https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html

Minimal POM
The minimum requirement for a POM are the following:

project root
modelVersion - should be set to 4.0.0
groupId - the id of the project's group.
artifactId - the id of the artifact (project)
version - the version of the artifact under the specified group
Here's an example:

<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
 
  <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
  <version>1</version>
</project>

Dependency Scope
Dependency scope is used to limit the transitivity of a dependency and to determine when a dependency is included in a classpath.

There are 6 scopes:

- compile
This is the default scope, used if none is specified. Compile dependencies are available in all classpaths of a project. Furthermore, those dependencies are propagated to dependent projects.
- provided
This is much like compile, but indicates you expect the JDK or a container to provide the dependency at runtime. For example, when building a web application for the Java Enterprise Edition, you would set the dependency on the Servlet API and related Java EE APIs to scope provided because the web container provides those classes. A dependency with this scope is added to the classpath used for compilation and test, but not the runtime classpath. It is not transitive.
- runtime
This scope indicates that the dependency is not required for compilation, but is for execution. Maven includes a dependency with this scope in the runtime and test classpaths, but not the compile classpath.
- test
This scope indicates that the dependency is not required for normal use of the application, and is only available for the test compilation and execution phases. This scope is not transitive. Typically this scope is used for test libraries such as JUnit and Mockito. It is also used for non-test libraries such as Apache Commons IO if those libraries are used in unit tests (src/test/java) but not in the model code (src/main/java).
- system
This scope is similar to provided except that you have to provide the JAR which contains it explicitly. The artifact is always available and is not looked up in a repository.
- import
This scope is only supported on a dependency of type pom in the <dependencyManagement> section. It indicates the dependency is to be replaced with the effective list of dependencies in the specified POM's <dependencyManagement> section. Since they are replaced, dependencies with a scope of import do not actually participate in limiting the transitivity of a dependency.
Each of the scopes (except for import) affects transitive dependencies in different ways, as is demonstrated in the table below. If a dependency is set to the scope in the left column, a transitive dependency of that dependency with the scope across the top row results in a dependency in the main project with the scope listed at the intersection. If no scope is listed, it means the dependency is omitted.
